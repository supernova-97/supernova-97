I stared my coding journey in september '22 on CodeCademy. I successfully finished the "neue Fische" Web Development Bootcamp and now I'm ready to put what I've learned to good use. :grin: 

I  have experience in JavaScript, React.js, Vue.js & Typescript

Since I've always been interested in design as well, I did a UI / UX design course on Skillshare that gave me the necessary tricks and tools to make my applications visually appealing
Figma was also part of that class.

My other passions are **dogs** :dog:, going to the **gym** :muscle: and **Dolly Parton**. :purple_heart:
I'm also interested in AI, AI Art and Prompt Design and use MidJourney & ChatGPT to learn how to communicate with AI.
