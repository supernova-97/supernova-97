I have also worked with React and Next.js, which I'm using to build my own planning / social media app called CoPlan!
You can find it in my repository called "Capstone Project".

My other passions are **dogs** :dog:, going to the **gym** :muscle: and **Dolly Parton**. :purple_heart:
I'm also interested in AI, AI Art and Prompt Design and use MidJourney & ChatGPT to learn how to communicate with AI.
